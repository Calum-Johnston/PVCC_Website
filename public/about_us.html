                    <p>We are able to use the many and varied facilities of the school so are literally able to cater for most activities, ranging from creative arts to fitness-related projects.  The main reception is situated in the Sixth Form Centre itself and from there we have access to the rest of the complex.

There is a host of extra activities for all ages and interests operating at the Centre including: fitness and dance sessions; parent and baby exercise and music groups; children’s parties; health and information sessions; performing arts productions; flower arranging and much more. Specialist areas include  a 250 Seated Theatre, a Performing Arts Studio, a Sports Hall, a Gymnasium, an Outdoor Floodlit Astro Turf and a Playing Field. Skill-specific classrooms could be available for those seeking to run art, cookery, design or science-based activities.</p>
